    "# Abstract \n",
    "This project focuses on cluster analysis of songs based on the Spotify API’s audio feature measurements. We have collected 2,300 popular songs from the past two decades, with various audio features extracted from each song, such as tempo, energy, and valence. With this data, we will utilize a variety of machine learning algorithms to perform cluster analysis, with the end goal of categorizing songs based only on their audio features. If we determine that the songs do cluster based on these measurements, we will run several metrics to evaluate the model’s success. Afterward, we hope to interpret the clusters, and determine whether or not they resemble typical genre classifications. By uncovering the patterns and structures behind widely known music, this analysis seeks to enhance our understanding of music preferences, and hopefully contribute to improved music classification algorithms."

    "# Background\n",
    "\n",
    "Songs can have a variety of subjective qualities, but they typically group together into common categories, hence the existence of music genres. However, it’s difficult to quantify these categories, as it’s not clear what features of a song actually constitute them. The Spotify API offers a solution to this: for every song, it includes measurements of various audio features, such as tempo, energy, and danceability <a name=\"one\"></a>[<sup>[1]</sup>](#onenote). It has already been shown that these audio features can be used to predict a song’s genre with various rates of success <a name=\"two\"></a>[<sup>[2]</sup>](#twonote)<a name=\"three\"></a>[<sup>[3]</sup>](#threenote). However, it is not clear whether or not these audio feature measurements tend to cluster together on their own, without the aid of genre labels. Additionally, even if they do cluster into discrete groups, we do not know whether these groups would resemble typical genres (e.g. pop, hip-hop, rock), or if they would follow some other way of classifying music <a name=\"four\"></a>[<sup>[4]</sup>](#fournote).\n",
    "\n",
    "As such, we are interested in determining how popular music tends to group together based on its audio feature measurements, without the influence of genre labels."

    "# Problem Statement\n",
    "\n",
    "We aim to determine underlying patterns and structures behind audio features in popular music. Specifically, we will look at numerical measurements and ratings of top songs (e.g. duration, tempo, energy, etc.), and observe how these songs cluster together based on these properties. Some specific ML solutions we can apply to this would be k-means clustering, GMM, PCA, and LDA depending on how well a linear solution would work on our dataset."

    "# Data\n",

    "For our project, we'll examine the Billboard Year-End Hot 100 songs spanning from 2000 to 2023. In this current dataset, there are 2,300 songs (with 2,300 observations), and 22 variables including basic info about the artist, album, release date, as well as Spotify audio features like liveness, valence, and tempo. The dataset can be found here.\n",
    "\n",
    "We have another dataset, titled genre.csv, which also includes information about each song, but mostly information about the artists. Additionally, this dataset does not include duplicate songs, so it only has 2,117 rows (instead of 2,300). For each song, it includes the artist type (person or group), the artist gender, and the song genre.\n",
    "\n",
    "The critical variables will be the audio features, which are mostly represented with floats. It’s not clear that we’ll need to do much cleaning, but we might need to do some scaling or dimensionality reduction before analysis.\n"

    "# Proposed Solution\n",
    "\n",
    "Our main plan involves several steps. First, we plan to reduce the dimensionality of our data using PCA, in order to prepare it for clustering. We plan to use K-means clustering to form the clusters. To determine the optimal number of clusters, we will use the Elbow method. Once we have reached an optimal solution, we will evaluate it with the Silhouette Score, as described below."

Once we determine the appropriate number of clusters and come to a conclusion using unsupervised machine learning methods, we can see how well our models generalize and utilize the labels with supervised machine learning, since we have the types and number of genres.
